# Product Requirements Document: AI-Powered Lead Qualification System

## Feature Name
**AI-Powered Lead Qualification System with Intelligent Routing**

## Problem Statement

### Current State Pain Points
Jacob Kazadi Kayembe's portfolio site effectively showcases AI expertise and marketing automation capabilities, but currently lacks intelligent lead capture and qualification mechanisms. The existing contact flow presents several challenges:

1. **Unqualified Lead Overflow**: All contact form submissions are treated equally, regardless of project scope, budget, or urgency
2. **Manual Screening Overhead**: Jacob must manually review and categorize each inquiry, consuming valuable time that could be spent on high-value client work
3. **Missed Opportunity Identification**: High-potential leads may not be prioritized quickly enough, potentially losing business to competitors
4. **Generic Response Experience**: All inquiries receive the same initial response, missing opportunities for personalized engagement
5. **No Lead Intelligence**: Lack of data-driven insights about visitor intent, company size, or project complexity

### Business Impact
- **Time Inefficiency**: 3-5 hours weekly spent manually qualifying and responding to leads
- **Revenue Leakage**: Estimated 15-20% of high-value opportunities may be delayed or lost due to slow response times
- **Poor User Experience**: Generic contact forms don't reflect the sophisticated AI capabilities Jacob offers to clients
- **Missed Demonstration**: The contact process doesn't showcase Jacob's AI integration expertise

### Target Solution
Implement an AI-powered lead qualification system that automatically assesses, categorizes, and routes inquiries while providing personalized experiences that demonstrate Jacob's AI capabilities to potential clients.
